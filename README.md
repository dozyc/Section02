# Bull Cow Game

This is a word-guessing game. It's implemented in a terminal executable.

The player tries to guess the hidden word. After each guess the game provides the player feedback as to the number of BULLS (correct letters in the correct place), and COWS (correct letters in the wrong place) in their guess.

The player uses deduction to guess the word. If they guess the exact word before the number of tries expires, they win!
